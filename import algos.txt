1. All possible substring
2. Making the two dimensional matrix to single dimensional
3. for n nodes the binary tree that can be generated T(n) = 2nCn / n+ 1
4. Max height trees in the above possibilities are 2 power (n-1)
5. Inorder with either preorder or post order can define a tree uniquely
6. Post order and level are most common way of solving problem in the binary tree
7. Deleting a node from binary search tree
	a. if no child then parent refering to the child will become null
	b. if one child then the parent will refer this child
	c. else inorder successor or inorder predecessor (first left and extreme right or first right and extreme left). if it is not leaf node then the current node's will be called recursievely step 3
